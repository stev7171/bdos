### Bearded Dragon OS (BDOS)

Bearded Dragon OS is a fake "simulator" OS that I'm going to use as a base for my next "simulator" OS. It's just a kernel, but it has an interpreter,  
and the ability to run python code.  

### How to use BDOS

BDOS is pretty easy to use, just type "help" in the CLI. but if you want to run a .RUN file, you need to type run:[INT]:<filename>.  
BDOS also uses colons (:) instead of spaces ( ). But other than that, it's pretty self-explanatory.
